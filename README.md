## Description :house:

HolbertonBnB is a complete RESTful web application, integrating file and
database (MySQL) storage in a back-end API with front-end interfacing in a
clone of AirBnB. The front-end is designed using HTML5/CSS3 and is served using
Python Flask. The application is configured on a distributed system - two web
servers and one load balancer - with Nginx and HAProxy.

HolbertonBnB is still in active development, with complete functionality set to
deploy in the coming month:

* Complete integration of a RESTful API
* Full configuration of website with domain name
* Serving of dynamic content using JavaScript
